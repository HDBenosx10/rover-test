## Test Rover

### Description

#### Problem
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on
Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated
by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view
of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.
A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x
and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal
compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify
navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the
rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.
In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters.
The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the
rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from
its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain
the same heading.
Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
Input
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the
plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that
have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line
gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of
instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by
spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's
orientation.
Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second
rover won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.
Output
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and
heading.

##### Test Input
```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```
##### Expected Output
```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```
`yarn` to install dependencies <br><br>
`yarn build` builds `dist` directory with transpiled code <br><br>
`yarn build:watch` same but keeps re-building on file changes <br><br>
`yarn test` run tests suits <br><br>
`yarn start` run the application
